# Rate-Limit

Rate Limit: Rate limiting is the identification of hostile traffic sources by the rates at which they are attempting to access resources within a network. A web security solution monitors the frequency and timing of incoming requests from each requestor. When a given requestor exceeds the specified rate limit, that requestor is blocked from further access for a specified length of time.

No rate limiting : Rate limiting is a process to limit requests possible. It is used to control network traffic.Suppose a web server allows upto 20 requests per minute. If you try to send more than 20 requests, an error will be triggered. This is necessary to prevent the attackers from sending excessive requests to the server.

Impact : No rate limit is a flaw that doesn't limit the no. of attempts one makes on a website server to extract data.It is a vulnerability which can prove to be critical when misused by attackers.
